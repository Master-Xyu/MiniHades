# UE5 Hades Prototype Project README
This project is the result of personal practice based on [Yang Yiming's UE5 3D Hades Replication Pure Blueprint Tutorial](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1de4y1c7vo?vd_source=49683f4d8512b7464671f7f5146a12fe&spm_id_from=333.788.videopod.sections). By learning this tutorial, a prototype of the Hades game is imitated using the pure blueprint function of UE5, aiming to deeply master skills in aspects such as the UE5 blueprint system, game mechanism construction, and character action design.
